Project 1: A Simple MIPS Disassembler

Group: 3
Group members:	1. Mohammad Nadim
				2. Md. Musaddaqul Hasib
				3. Md. Khairul Anam
				
Description
------------
The MIPS disassembler is coded in python (2.7.12).
This code will take file name as input from user.
The file must contain 32 bit binary data stream.
The code then finds out the MIPS instruction for each stream. 
The MIPS instruction are then stored in "output.txt" file.


Run
----
1. In Linux terminal write: python MIPS.py.
2. Write input file name. Ex. "input.txt".
3. Output will be generated in "output.txt".
